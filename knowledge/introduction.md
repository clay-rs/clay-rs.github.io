Clay is fast, modular and extendable Monte-Carlo ray tracing engine written in Rust and OpenCL.

**Ray tracing** is a technique of generating photorealistic images via simulation of
light rays propagation according to the rules of geometric optics.

**Monte-Carlo** is a method of finding integrals by accumulating values of integrating
function in randomly sampled points. In ray tracing we are finding the light integral
in each pixel of our virtual camera.
